* loaded the dataset for Airlines passengers
* There were 96 observations and 2 features
* The dataset has count of airline passengers for every month from 1995 to 2002
* Created t, t_square, log_passengers columns in the dataset
* Created month, year, dummy variables for each month columns in the dataset from the date column.
* Divided the data into train and test data
* Trained the various models on train data and calculated RMSE values for the test data.

* Selected 'rmse_Mult_add_sea' model for predicting passenger count as it has the lowest RMSE Value.
* Then created 'new_data' dataset from the original dataset for which we need to forecast Airline's passenger count using the 'rmse_Mult_add_sea' model 
* Deleted passengers, log passengers column as we need to forecast these values.
* Predicted the passenger count using the best model and plotted graph for the forecasted passengers.
